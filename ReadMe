1. Dataset Overview
Features: Cell size, shape, texture, and density.

Target: Diagnosis (Benign = 0, Malignant = 1).

2. Data Preprocessing
Splitting: 80% training, 20% testing.

Scaling: Standardization (mean = 0, std = 1).

Label Encoding: Converts diagnosis into numerical format.

3. Neural Network Architecture
Input Layer: ReLU activation, He Normal Initialization, L2 regularization.

Hidden Layers: Dropout for overfitting prevention.

Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

4. Model Compilation
Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate).

Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy.

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy.

5. Training Strategy
Mini-batch gradient descent for weight updates.

Validation on test set to monitor generalization.

6. Model Evaluation
High Accuracy (~95-99%) → Good performance.

Overfitting → High train accuracy, low test accuracy.

Underfitting → Low accuracy on both sets.
